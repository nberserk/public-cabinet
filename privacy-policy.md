# Privacy Policy for The Cabinet Extension

**Last Updated: [Current Date]**

## Overview

The Cabinet ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use The Cabinet Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

### Data Stored Locally
The Cabinet stores the following information locally on your device using Chrome's storage API:

- **Tab Information**: URLs, titles, favicons, and hierarchical relationships of tabs you choose to save as Cabinets
- **Cabinet Metadata**: Names you assign to saved Cabinets, creation dates, and organizational data
- **Extension Settings**: Your preferences for how the extension operates

### Data We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect any personal information
- We do not track your browsing history beyond what you explicitly save as Cabinets
- We do not transmit any data to external servers

## How We Use Information

The information stored locally is used solely to:
- Save and restore your tab hierarchies as Cabinets
- Provide the hierarchical navigation interface
- Remember your extension preferences
- Enable the core functionality of the extension

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage APIs
- **No External Transmission**: Your data never leaves your device
- **User Control**: You can delete any saved Cabinet at any time
- **Chrome Security**: Data is protected by Chrome's built-in security measures

## Permissions Explained

The Cabinet requests the following Chrome permissions:

### "tabs" Permission
- **Purpose**: To read tab information (URLs, titles, relationships) and manage tab operations
- **Usage**: Only used when you actively save Cabinets or use the navigation features
- **Limitation**: We only access tabs in windows where you use the extension

### "storage" Permission

The Cabinet does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The extension is designed for general productivity use and does not target children specifically.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
